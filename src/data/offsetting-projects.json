While boiling water helps reduce exposure to water-borne diseases, the indoor air pollution created by wood fires causes serious respiratory and heart problems. A Cambodian social enterprise, has set out to change this with its locally made ceramic water purifiers. With a filter in their homes, families no longer need to boil their water to make it safe. This reduces indoor air pollution and protects vulnerable forests.",
